# test_christmas_ale
A hobby-based project while I am trying to learn Python and Streamlit. 
It is the score of me and my friends last three years of Christmas ale-tests. 
Data taken from Excel, converted to CSV and processed in Streamlit. 
The code is a mess and a lot of it I don`t understand as I had to copy some parts of it.
But it works as intended. Ish.
